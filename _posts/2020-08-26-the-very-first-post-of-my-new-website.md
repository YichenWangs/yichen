_Phew_ - finally starting to upgrade my website! 

After being many years of a _CS_ nerd (4yrs so far:)), and having a suspect intention to become a philosopher (yep - you saw it right), here we go: a new website has launched about Yichen - a weird combo interests in human-centered computing, art, philosophy, photography, humanity and etc. More importantly, she is on her way to become a better human being :)



Special thanks to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), powering this website.
